# Lightning Node

This project realises a lightning receiver node on a NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP8266).
The status of the project is still experimental, although I have a working prototype on duty :-)

The node is meant to be permanently connected to a Wifi and MQTT server, and pushed the data as json when detected.

Use the provided .ino file and adjust the configuration section to your need.
