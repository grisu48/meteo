# Experiments

## Experiment 1 / 2017-07-31

''Serial connection ok, but no useful data''

I've setup and soldered the system and put it in the garden with my BananaPi.
Connected the Arduino with USB to the BananaPi.
Readouts are clear, the system was running stable for 1 1/2 days without dropping the serial connection.

I've disconnected the system, improved the readout daemon a bit and will try to read the system out on my laptop when a thunderstorm is approaching.
